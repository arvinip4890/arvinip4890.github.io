		<H4>Wants, Scarcity and Choice</H4>

Scarcity means that resources are limited, and because resources are scarce, people must make choices.</p>

		<p>Free Good and Economic Good- Free Good is the good that is the item of consumption (such as air) that is useful to people, is naturally in abundant supply, and needs no conscious effort to obtain it.

Normative economic statements are opinion based, so they cannot be proved or disproved.</p>
